                The ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023, to be hosted by India, will be the 13th edition of the
                50-over World Cup. India will be hosting the quadrennial tournament for the fourth time in its history,
                and the
                tournament is set to take place in 2023. <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 500;">
                Ten teams will contest for the coveted trophy. The tournament will follow a similar format to the 2019
                edition
                in England and Wales, with a round-robin stage followed by the knockouts. <br>
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 500;">
                All 10 teams will compete against each other once in the round-robin stage. A victory earns the winning
                side two
                points in every match, while a no-result will mean the sides share a point each. <br>
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 500;">
                The top four teams at the end of the round-robin stage will qualify for the semi-finals. The winners of
                the two
                subsequent semi-finals will contest in the final, where the champion will be crowned. <br>

                The ICC Cricket World Cup Super League 2020-23 will be the main qualification pathway for the
                tournament. The
                top seven sides in the CWCSL table, along with India, who will qualify automatically as hosts, will gain
                direct
                entry into the tournament. <br>
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 500;">
                The five remaining teams on the CWCSL table, the top three teams from ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 and
                the top
                two team teams from the 2023 World Cup Qualifier Play-off will then contest in the 2023 Cricket World
                Cup
                Qualifier, which will decide the final two teams to qualify for the World Cup. <br>

            <span style="font-weight: 500;">
                The 2023 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup will be the 13th edition of the tournament. The tournament first
                took place
                in 1975 in England. <br>
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 500;"> </span>
            This will be the fourth time that India will be hosting the tournament and the first time that it will be
            the
            sole host. They previously co-hosted the tournament in 1987, 1996 and 2011. <br>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 500;">
                England are the defending champions heading into the tournament, having won the trophy on home soil in
                2019
                after defeating New Zealand in a thrilling final at Lord’s. <br>
            </span>
        </p>
        <span style="font-weight: 500;">
            Australia are the most successful team in the history of the Cricket World Cup, having won the tournament a
            record five times. West Indies and India have won the tournament twice, while England, Pakistan and Sri
            Lanka
            have each lifted the trophy once. <br>
